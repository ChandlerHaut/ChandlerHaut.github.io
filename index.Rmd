# Welcome to My Webpage

My name is Chandler Haut and I am a father, UVU graduate, and outdoor enthusiast. I am currently living in Utah and fulfilling my dream of becoming a wildlife biologist. The outdoors have been a passion of mine since I was a kid and I strive to protect them for future generations to come.
