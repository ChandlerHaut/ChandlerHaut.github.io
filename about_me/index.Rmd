### **Military Service**
##### **U.S. Marine Corps, 2016-2020**

The Marines gave me many great oppurtunites over my tour of service. I was stationed in Iwakuni, Japan as a requistion manager with Marine Air Group 12. I was then transferred to Combat Logistics Battalion in California, U.S. where I managed property and fiscal accounts. While I was with CLB-11, I was also deployed with Marine Expeditionary Unit 11 and saw countries such as Qatar, India, and the Philipines.

### **Younger Years**

I was born and raised in Jamestown, North Dakota where I cherished the outdoors. Through my experiences of camping, hunting, and fishing I grew a passion for the environment. This lead me to pursue the career I am today in the field of Wildlife Bilolgy.
