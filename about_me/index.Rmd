### **Current Postition: Wildlife Technician**

I am currently a wildlife technician at Camp Williams, Bluffdale, UT. My primary responsibilities are small mammals which include mist netting bats, operating pit fall traps, and conducting sherman trapping surveys. However, we are a team so assisting the avian and reptile techs occurs daily. 



### **Undergraduate**

I completed my undergraduate at Utah Valley University where I earned a degree in Integrated Studies with an emphasis in Wildlife Biology.

### **Military Service**
##### **U.S. Marine Corps, 2016-2020**

The Marines gave me many great opportunities over my tour of service. I was stationed in Iwakuni, Japan as a requisition manager with Marine Air Group 12. I was then transferred to Combat Logistics Battalion 11 in California, U.S. where I managed property and fiscal accounts. While I was with CLB-11, I was also deployed with Marine Expeditionary Unit 11 and saw countries such as Qatar, India, and the Philippines.

### **Early Life**

I was born and raised in Jamestown, North Dakota where I cherished the outdoors. Through my experiences of camping, hunting, and fishing I grew a passion for the environment. This lead me to pursue the career I am today in the field of Wildlife Bilolgy.
